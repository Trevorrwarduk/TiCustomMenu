/*
 * TiCustomMenu
 *
 * This project has been developed to give a start for Titanium developers who wish to
 * have an application which uses the same menu on iPhone, iPad and Android devices.
 *
 * It is a starting point of using a custom menu and commonJS architecture. It is provided
 * as open source code to enable the developer to adapt this template to their own requirements.
 *
 * The directory structure used within this template is based on an MVC guideline. It is there
 * to get you started, and you may have your own company or individual guidelines you need to follow.
 *
 * Also i use JSLint validation all through the application so functions appear in the right order
 * in modules and there are no spurious scope variable issues.
