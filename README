TiCustomMenu

This project has been developed to give a start for Titanium developers who wish to
have an application which uses the same menu on iPhone, iPad and Android devices.

It is a starting point of using a custom menu and commonJS architecture. It is provided
as open source code to enable the developer to adapt this template to their own requirements.

The directory structure used within this template is based on an MVC guideline. It is there
to get you started, and you may have your own company or individual guidelines you need to follow.

Also I use JSLint validation all through the application so functions appear in the right order
in modules and there are no spurious scope variable issues.

This application uses different ui settings files to allow you to switch between color schemes.
It uses buttons on the screen to enable this but you will hopefully see how quickly it would be
to use a permanent setting to allow your users to select their own.

Also the different color images are provided so you can just setup one for your application.
